# Decorators Project

This project demonstrates the use of TypeScript decorators, including class, method, and accessor decorators, to enhance functionality in a TypeScript application.

## Description

The project includes:
- A class decorator (`SimpleLogger`) that logs when a class is instantiated.
- A method decorator (`LogMethod`) that logs method calls and their arguments.
- An accessor decorator (`MyReadOnly`) that makes a property read-only.

## How to Run
- tsc
- node .\decoratorsSimpleLogger.js
